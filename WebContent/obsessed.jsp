<h2> Obese: > 30</h2>
</td></tr>
<tr><td>Overweight and obesity are defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that may impair health.
Body mass index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height that is commonly used to classify overweight and obesity in adults.
It is defined as a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of his height in meters (kg/m2).

What causes obesity and overweight?
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
The fundamental cause of obesity and overweight is an energy imbalance between calories consumed and calories expended. Globally, there has been:
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
1) An increased intake of energy-dense foods that are high in fat.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
2) An increase in physical inactivity due to the increasingly sedentary nature of many forms of work, changing modes of transportation, and increasing urbanization.
</td></tr>
<tr><td>
3) Changes in dietary and physical activity patterns are often the result of environmental and societal changes associated with development and lack of supportive 
policies in sectors such as health, agriculture, transport, urban planning, environment, food processing, distribution, marketing, and education.

<h3>How can overweight and obesity be reduced?</h3>
<br>
<tr><td>How can overweight and obesity be reduced?
</td></tr>
<tr><td> Overweight and obesity, as well as their related noncommunicable diseases, are largely preventable. 
Supportive environments and communities are fundamental in shaping people's choices, by making the choice of healthier foods and regular physical activity the easiest choice (the choice that is the most accessible, available and affordable), and therefore preventing overweight and obesity.
<tr><td>At the individual level, people can:
<br>
<br>1)limit energy intake from total fats and sugars;
<br>2)increase consumption of fruit and vegetables, as well as legumes, whole grains and nuts; and
<br>3)engage in regular physical activity (60 minutes a day for children and 150 minutes spread through the week for adults).
<br>4)Individual responsibility can only have its full effect where people have access to a healthy lifestyle.
<br>5)Therefore, at the societal level it is important to support individuals in following the recommendations above, through sustained implementation of evidence based and population based policies that make regular physical activity and healthier dietary choices available, affordable and easily accessible to everyone, particularly to the poorest individuals.
<br>6)An example of such a policy is a tax on sugar sweetened beverages.</tr></td>
